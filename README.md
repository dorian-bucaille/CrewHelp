# CrewHelp (WIP)
Tool designed to help crewmates expose imposters in Among Us.
This script would not exist without the excellent work of Ben from Learn Code By Gaming. Go [check him out !](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnCodeByGaming)

## What does this tool do ?
The purpose of this tool is to display a map giving the last positions of the players encountered at each meeting. For the moment it's not functional, but I'll do my best to make it work.

## WIP
Right now only basic player detection is possible. Here are some screenshots of the program :

## To do

- [ ] Improve map display :
  - [x] colors
  - [ ] crewmate icons
- [ ] Performance improvements with multithreading
(- [ ] Advanced player detection with ML (cascade))

## Other
I'm fully aware that image recognition is absolutely not the best way to track players in Among Us. This project is mainly a way for me to learn new techniques and libraries in Python.
I do not encourage people to cheat in online games and am not responsible for any abuse. __Do not use this script in online games__.
